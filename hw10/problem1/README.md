# HW10 â€” Problem 1

## Problem statement

> Hey, I saw ur course project u posted the other day

> Looks fun!

Obviously, Bob was easily excited.

> What do u think is the hardest part?

That was actually a good question. You thought about it for a minute and typed back: "Reading the species list from a file and using it to populate the world, maybe?"

> That's what I thought too!

> But I saw something similar on StackOverflow the other day

"Hmm...", you responded noncommittally. Bob didn't reply right away. When he did two hours later, it was a link to a few test cases and a plea for help. 

Help Bob finish his basic species streaming implementation according to the [provided test cases](https://repl.it/@agurtovoy/hw10-problem1) ([`main.cpp`](main.cpp)) . **Do not modify the tests.**
